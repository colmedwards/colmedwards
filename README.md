- 👋 Hi, I’m @colmedwards
- 👀 I’m interested in changing careers from ccivil engineering to a data analyst role, and am actively studying to achieve this. Over the next few months I hope to have the beginnings of a DA portfolio here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and sql - mostly from DataQuest and Coursera. Tableau sooon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to reach out too fellow learners and noobs, and maybe eventually a mentor.
- 📫 Reach me here...I've deleted all the normal social media channels - and enjoying the silence :)
